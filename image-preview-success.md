# SUCCESS: Image Previews Are Working!

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING

The image previews are actually working perfectly! Looking at the latest search result for "Tesla Model 3 latest design", I can see:

### ✅ Image Previews Displayed:
- 4 large image thumbnails showing Tesla Model 3 cars
- Images are displayed in a 2x2 grid layout at the top
- Images show actual Tesla Model 3 photos with different angles and designs

### ✅ Sources Section:
- Text-based source cards below the images
- Sources include: "BYD ups the ante on Tesla's Model 3", "Model 3 | Tesla Canada", etc.
- Proper source attribution with numbered references

### ✅ Layout Matches Original:
- Images at the top in grid format (like the original Morphic screenshot)
- Sources section below with text cards
- Clean, organized layout

## What Was Fixed:
The image previews were already implemented correctly. The issue was that:
1. Previous searches might not have returned images from Tavily
2. The debug logging confirmed the system is working
3. The SearchResultsImageSection component is functioning properly

## Current Implementation:
- ✅ Tavily API returns images with `include_images: true`
- ✅ SearchArtifactContent conditionally renders images
- ✅ SearchResultsImageSection displays images in grid format
- ✅ Images are clickable and open in modal dialogs

The image preview functionality is working exactly like the original Morphic!
