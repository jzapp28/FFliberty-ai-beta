# Original Morphic Search Analysis

## Test Results from morphic.sh

### Query: "What are the latest news about Tesla stock today?"

### Response:
"I'm unable to provide real-time news updates or stock prices as my training only includes information up to October 2023, and I don't have access to live data. To get the latest news about Tesla stock, I recommend checking financial news websites, stock market apps, or platforms like Bloomberg, CNBC, or Yahoo Finance. You can also look at Tesla's official investor relations page for the most accurate and up-to-date information."

## Key Observations:

1. **No Web Search Performed**: The original Morphic.sh also did NOT perform web search
2. **No Sources Displayed**: No citations or source links were shown
3. **No Real-time Data**: The response explicitly states no access to live data
4. **Similar Behavior**: The original behaves exactly like our implementation

## Conclusion:
The original Morphic.sh appears to have the same limitation - it's not actually performing web searches in search mode. This suggests either:
1. The live demo has search disabled
2. The search functionality requires authentication
3. There's a configuration issue with the live demo
4. The search mode might work differently than expected

## Next Steps:
Need to examine the actual source code from the GitHub repository to understand how search is supposed to work, rather than relying on the live demo.
