# Image Preview Issue Analysis

## Current Implementation:
The search functionality is working correctly and Tavily API is returning images, but the image previews are not showing in the UI like the original Morphic.

## Key Findings:

### 1. Tavily API Returns Images:
- ✅ `include_images: true` is set in Tavily request
- ✅ `include_image_descriptions: true` is enabled
- ✅ Images are processed and returned in `searchResult.images`

### 2. Components Exist for Image Display:
- ✅ `SearchResultsImageSection` component exists and is functional
- ✅ `SearchArtifactContent` conditionally renders images if they exist
- ✅ Image grid layout is implemented (2x2 preview, 2x3 full mode)

### 3. The Problem:
Looking at the `SearchArtifactContent` component:
```typescript
{searchResults.images && searchResults.images.length > 0 && (
  <SearchResultsImageSection
    images={searchResults.images}
    query={query}
    displayMode="full"
  />
)}
```

The images should be displayed if `searchResults.images` exists and has length > 0.

## Potential Issues:
1. Images might not be returned by Tavily API
2. Images might be filtered out during processing
3. The search artifact might not be using the correct component
4. Images might be empty or malformed

## Next Steps:
1. Add debug logging to see if images are being returned
2. Check the actual search response structure
3. Verify the SearchArtifactContent is being used correctly
