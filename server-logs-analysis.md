# Critical Issue Found in Server Logs

## Debug Output Shows the Problem:
```
üîç Search Mode Debug: { searchModeCookie: undefined, searchMode: false, chatMode: 'speed' }
```

## Analysis:
1. **searchModeCookie: undefined** - The search-mode cookie is not being set or sent
2. **searchMode: false** - This means search tools are disabled
3. **chatMode: 'speed'** - The chat mode is defaulting to 'speed' instead of 'search'

## Root Cause:
The SearchModeToggle component is not being used or the cookie is not persisting properly.

## Additional Issue:
There's also a client-side error:
```
ReferenceError: document is not defined at getCookie
```

This suggests the getCookie function is being called during server-side rendering, which doesn't have access to `document`.

## Solutions Needed:
1. Fix the client-side cookie access issue
2. Ensure the SearchModeToggle component is properly integrated
3. Verify cookie persistence across requests
4. Add proper client-side only guards for cookie access
