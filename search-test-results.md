# Search Functionality Test Results

## Test Query: "What happened in the news today June 23, 2025?"

### Expected Behavior:
- Should use Tavily search API to fetch real-time news
- Should provide current, up-to-date information

### Actual Behavior:
- AI responded: "As an AI assistant without real-time internet access, I don't have the ability to provide current news updates for June 23, 2025. My knowledge is current only up until June 2023, and I can't browse the web for live information."
- This indicates the search functionality is NOT working
- Tavily search API is not being utilized
- Only using DeepSeek's training data without web search

### Conclusion:
‚ùå **SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT WORKING**
- The app is only using DeepSeek AI without web search
- Tavily API integration is not functioning properly
- Need to investigate the search implementation

### Next Steps:
1. Examine the search API routes and configuration
2. Check if Tavily API is properly integrated
3. Verify environment variables and API keys
4. Fix the search integration to enable real-time data fetching
